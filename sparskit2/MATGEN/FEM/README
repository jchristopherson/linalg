                 SPARSKIT  Modules  FEM

---------------------------------------------------------------

    This directory contains the SPARSKIT FEM module,
    a matrix generator for finite element matrices.

contents:
=========

    convdif.f  == a driver to generate a matrix and some associated plots 
    functns2.o == functions needed by the driver -- define the coefficients
                  of the PDE
    meshes.f   == set of sample meshes defined as inout to the driver
    makefile   == a makefile for an executable to generate a sample mesh 
    elmtlib2.f == a small finite element library 

mat.hb is a test matrix.

Two output files are provided:  mat.ps and msh.ps.  You may wish to save
these to another name before running the test program so that you may
compare your output to these files.
