 SUBDIRECTORY MATEXP 
 -------------------
 routines related to matrix exponentials. 

 contents:
---------- 
 exppro.f    computes exp( t A) v
 rexp.f      a simple test program for exppro.f
 phipro.f    solves y'= A y + b
 rphi.f      a simple test program for phipro.f
 makefile    makefile for the test problems. make exp.ex will make
             an executable for exppro, make phi.ex will test program for
             phipro.f


 feedback appreciated.  BEWARE: DOCUMENTATION MAY BE INACCURATE -
 ---------------------  VERY LITTLE TESTING DONE WITH PHIPRO.F --
