* psgrd.f contains subroutine "psgrid" which plots a symmetric graph.

* texplt1.f contains subroutine "texplt" allows several matrices
  in the same picture by calling texplt several times and exploiting job and
  different shifts.

* texgrid1.f contains subroutine "texgrd" which generates tex commands
  for plotting a symmetric graph associated with a mesh. Allows  
  several grids in the same picture by calling texgrd several times and 
  exploiting job and different shifts.
